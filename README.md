👋 Hi, I’m Jass. I build the engine and polish the chrome.
I started my career in Graphic and Industrial Design, obsessed with aesthetics and ergonomics. That evolved into a passion for UX/UI, but I eventually got tired of just "dreaming" up products—I wanted to build them.

Now, I’m a Software Engineer who treats code like a CAD model: precise, systematic, and built to last. I specialize in bridging the gap between high-level design vision and high-performance functional reality.

Design DNA: Systems thinking, pixel perfection, and user advocacy.

Engineering Core: Building tools that are as powerful as they are intuitive.

Off-duty: Likely hiking to a waterfall, getting lost in an art museum, or painting.

Let’s build something that looks as good as it runs.
